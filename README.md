# file-sort

This program uses a polyphase mergesort algorithm to sort a text file. Each line of text in the file is assumed to be a seperate record and must end with	an endline ('\n') character. Additionally, it assumes that	there is a string of numbers at a specific position within each line of text that is used as the sort key for that line of text. It does the sort by performing the following steps: (1)create a total of MAX_SRT_FILES sort files to be used to temporarily hold text data; (2) read up to MAX_ARR_SZ lines of a text file into a buffer array, where each element of the array consists of the text string and an integer key that is copied from the text string; (3) sort the array by the key; (4) find the lowest key in the buffer that is greater	than the last key read, and copy the text string associated with that	key from the buffer to a temporary sort file; (5) read in one new line of text into the buffer and resort the buffer; (7) repeat from step 3 until there are no more keys left that are greater than the last key read; (8) repeat from step 2 until the last sort file has been filled; (9) read the first text string from each of the sort files into a tempfile array and get the integer key from each line of text; (10) Find the lowest key in the tempfile array and write the associated text string into a temporary holder file;	(11) read a new text string from the sort file which previously had the lowest key and get the key from that string; (12) repeat from	step 10 until all sort files have been fully read; (13) erase the sort files and repeat from step 1 until the input file has been fully read.
